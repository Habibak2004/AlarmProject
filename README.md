#Play Personalized Alarm Program

## Overview
This program allows you to set an alarm for a specific time of day. Once the system time matches the set alarm time, the program will play a custom sound alarm. The alarm time can be set in **HH:MM** format, and the sound file can be provided as a path (e.g., `assets/alarmbirdsound.mp3`).

## Key Features
- Set the alarm for a specific time of the day.
- Play a custom alarm sound when the specified time is reached.
- Provides real-time feedback showing the current time and countdown status.

## Prerequisites
Before running the program, ensure the following are installed on your system:
- **Python** version 3.x.x (download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
- **pygame** library to handle sound playback. 


## Installation Instructions
